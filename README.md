# About

Big Mart is a big supermarket chain, with stores all around the country and its current
board set out a challenge to all Data Scientist out there to help them create a model that
can predict the sales, per product, for each store to give accurate results. Big Mart has
collected sales data from Kaggle, for various products across different stores in different
cities. With this information the corporation hopes we can identify the products and
stores which play a key role in their sales and use that information to take the correct
measures to ensure success of their business.
